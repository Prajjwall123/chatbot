Mental Health Support Chatbot Application

dataa/ contains .pdf files for vector embeddings creation.
faiss_database contains faiss index file.
requirements.txt contains all dependencies required for this project.
vectorstore_creation.ipnyb contains code to create vector store using huggingface transformer models


1.hugging face transformers -> convert the pdf text into vector embeddings to compare meanings

hugging face pretrained model called sentence-transformers

2.FAISS(Facebook AI similarity search)

stores the embeddings and allows quick similarity search

3.Mistral LLM model 

Flow:
user asks question-> convert query to embedding-> use FAISS to find most similar document chunks -> send those chunks and user's question document to LLM(Mistral) for answering

After getting question, and question is converted to embedding, FAISS used to find relevant document, then mistral generates answer based on that question


**Don't forget to add .env file with HF_TOKEN variable.**
